## Installation
Install node.js and npm. Then, clone this repo.

## Usage
Type "node index.js" in the terminal and you will be prompted with a series of questions about your team, starting with the team manager. You can keep adding engineers and interns until your team is complete. When you have entered information for every team member, select "I'm done". You will see an html appear in the "dist" folder. This is your team profile page!
